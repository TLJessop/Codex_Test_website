          Studio North is led by artist Maya Linden. We create atmospheric
          visuals for brands, publishers, and spaces that want a human touch.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every project begins with a moodboard conversation and a gentle
          timeline. From there, we deliver layered sketches, color exploration,
          and final assets in print-ready and digital formats.
